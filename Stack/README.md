![Stack](stack.png)

A Stack is an abstract and linear data structure that is open to single-sided inputs and outputs, created to hold data. In stacks, the logic of 'First in, Last out' or 'Last in, First out' applies.

To better understand the topic, let's look at examples of stacks that we might encounter in daily life. For instance, consider a box of chalks stacked on top of each other. The chalk at the bottom is the first one placed, and to remove it from the box, we need to first take out all the other chalks stacked on top of it. This process is an example of the 'First in, Last out' operation.
