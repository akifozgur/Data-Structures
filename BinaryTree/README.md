Binary Trees are a special type of Tree structure where each node can have at most two children.

Here are some characteristics of Binary Trees:
- If we consider the level of the root node as zero, then the number of nodes at level d in a binary tree is 2ᵈ. For example, at the root level (level 0), there can be at most ²⁰ = 1 node, while at level 5, there can be at most ²⁵ = 32 nodes.
- If we consider the depth of the root node as one, the maximum number of nodes in a binary tree with height h (Height of Tree) is 2ʰ-1. For instance, a binary tree with a height of 5 can have a maximum of 31 nodes.
- If we consider the depth of the root node as one, and the number of nodes in the binary tree as N, the minimum height and minimum level of the tree can be found as log₂(N+1). For example, a binary tree with 6 nodes has a minimum height and minimum level of 3 (log₂7 = 2.8074, and non-integer values are rounded up to the nearest integer).
- If we consider the depth of the root node as one, the level of a binary tree with L leaf nodes is at least log₂L + 1. For example, a binary tree with 6 leaf nodes has a minimum level of 4 (log₂6 = 2.585 + 1 = 3.585, and non-integer values are rounded up to the nearest integer).
- In a binary tree where each node has either 0 or 2 children, the number of leaf nodes is always one more than the number of nodes with two children.
