![AVL Tree](AVL.png)

An AVL tree is a self-balancing Binary Search Tree (BST). Due to being a Binary Search Tree, an AVL tree can have at most two child nodes for any node, and all nodes in the left subtree of a node are smaller than the node, while all nodes in the right subtree are greater than the node.

As mentioned above, AVL trees are Balanced Binary Trees, meaning that the difference in height between the left and right subtrees for each node should be at most one. This balance can be disrupted by operations such as node insertion or deletion, and in such cases, AVL trees autonomously rebalance themselves.

In an AVL tree, each node maintains a data called Balance Factor, which represents the difference in heights between the left and right subtrees. The tree is considered balanced when the Balance Factor is -1, 0, or 1, and no rebalancing is required. However, if the Balance Factor deviates from these three values, the tree needs to be rebalanced. There are four ways to perform these rebalancing operations.

Balance Factor = Height of the Left Subtree — Height of the Right Subtree
