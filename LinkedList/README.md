![Linked List](linkedlist.png)

  
A linked list is a linear data structure consisting of a group of nodes, where each node points to the next node through a pointer.

Each node is composed of data and references/pointers to the next node(s) in the list. The last node has a "null" reference, indicating the end of the linked list.

The head node is the starting node of the linked list and contains a reference to the next node in the list. When the list is empty, the head node will have a null reference. The image above can give you an idea of how a linked list looks.
